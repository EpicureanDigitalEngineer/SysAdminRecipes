# System Administration Recipes

## Introduction

*System Administration Recipes* is a collection of recipes (HowTos, instructables, cheat sheets, *etc*.) for installing, maintaining and operating digital services. The recipes may prove interesting for system administrators who may in turn wish to help those recipes stay up-to-date and evolve.

The first theme of the collection is [**FreeBSD**](freebsd/): recipes to install, configure and maintain FreeBSD as a basis for running and providing digital services (like blogging platforms, document repositories, photo libraries, *etc*.). They include how to [install a secure (encrypted, mirrored) FreeBSD server when you have no access to the console on boot](freebsd/secure-server) and how to deliver services by [installing and maintaining a system of Jails on your FreeBSD server](freebsd/jails).

The collection includes also how to install various services on your FreeBSD server or Jail, like [installing and maintaining a ghost blogging platform](freebsd/ghost).

Future topics may include  `dc-in-a-box` (running a data centre on a single box using a FreeBSD hypervisor ala Proxmox); home automation with Home Assistant; digital management of photos/ebooks/documents/passwords/configurations.

## Points of attention

!!! warning
    If *System Administration* is the noble art of making computers work, System Administrators have also the responsibility when things don't work (which may be more often than we care to admit). While the recipes have all been tested as advertised, your mileage may vary when applying them. Make sure you know what you are doing when following any recipe as executing root-level commands may lead to catastrophic failure for your systems. And feel free to propose changes that will make the recipes better.
    
!!! warning
    Almost all recipes are based on choices the author has made based on his/her own analysis of suitability and risks involved. You should always validate if these choices match your own risk assesement and like a good chef, create the necessary variants that satisfy your risk appetite.
