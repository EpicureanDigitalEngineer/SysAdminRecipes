# FreeBSD Recipes

<img src="../img/freebsd-daemon.jpg" style="zoom:80%;" />

This is a collection of sysadmin recipes for FreeBSD. The include recipes to install the OS in specific circumstances or to install and run services under FreeBSD.

Using FreeBSD is a question of choice. Be it its [pedigree](https://www2.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/pubs/jrnl/2016-EMPSE-unix-history/html/unix-history.html), its [philosophy](https://blog.udemy.com/freebsd-vs-linux/) or its rock-solid performance, the question of choosing an operating system that matches your needs is sufficiently debated on the internet fora. The recipes provided here are for those of us that have chosen to use FreeBSD (mostly) as a server operating system.

## OS-level installation recipes
